# MonkCloud - A Inhouse Cloud Storage

## Introduction
MonkCloud is an in-house cloud solution built using **Flask** (Python) and **HTML/CSS** for private file storage and management. This project allows users to **upload, download, and manage files** securely within a private infrastructure. Compared to public cloud solutions, an in-house cloud offers better control over resources and security.

## Objectives
The primary goal of MonkCloud is to provide a **lightweight, user-friendly** cloud storage solution with the following features:
- **File Upload & Download**: Users can upload and retrieve files through a web-based interface.
- **Basic File Management**: A simple dashboard for managing stored files.
- **Flask Backend**: Handles HTTP requests for file handling and UI rendering.
- **HTML/CSS Frontend**: Provides an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Authentication (Optional)**: Basic login system to restrict access.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask (Python)**: Micro-framework for handling requests and rendering web pages.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and designing the user interface.
- **SQLite (Optional)**: For storing file metadata and user details.
- **JavaScript (Optional)**: Enhances UI interactions such as real-time file listing.

## System Architecture
MonkCloud is structured into the following components:
- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**: Web-based user interface for file operations.
- **Backend (Flask)**: Manages API requests and serves web pages.
- **Database (Optional - SQLite)**: Stores file metadata and user information.
- **File Storage**: Maintains uploaded files in a server directory.

## Key Features
